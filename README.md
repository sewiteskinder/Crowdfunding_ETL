# Crowdfunding_ETL

Eduardo Peris is my partner on this project, our codes were written collaboratively but we have separate codes and repositories.
-
"ETL_Mini_Project_SEskinder.ipynb" is where the four original excel files were transformed and saved as functioning csv files with correct data types
-
"project_2_ERD.png" shows the image describing the relationships between the four newly transformed csv files
-
"crowdfunding_db_schema.sql" is where four tables were created for the new csv files to be loaded into based on the relationships shown in the ERD png
-
"sql_table_screenshots" shows the screenshots of each table being loaded in and running correctly with the head of each table and its data
-
"Resources" houses the original four excel files and the four newly transformed csv files
